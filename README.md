# research-impact
Something of a mix of preprocessing scripts and analyses from working with EPMC, contribution data, REF2014 and creating a graph between authors papers and research methods. 

The raw csv data for creating the graphs are not contained in this repo as they contain specific user identifiable data. To run these scripts on real SAGE data please contact ian mulvany or harriet kenney. There is some sample data in a private dropbox repo for testing with.
